# Twitter Recommendation

### Current Status

This is an application to reccomend content to Twitter users. The file `app.py` can be run on a server and will respond to requests made to it (see what my reccomendations are for you!). The file `engine.py` is a simpler command-line version of the product, I don't prefer it but it is somewhat functional and allows you to provide feedback. 

### Future Development

Future development on this project will include moving the K-means computation out of the main engine. If you run the app it now it can take up to 5 minutes to make reccomendations, rather than just querying an existing model and providing feedback. This is a poorly scaled way of doing things, and is next in line to get fixed. 

### Shout-Outs

[Spyre](https://github.com/adamhajari/spyre) is a huge part of this app. Follow the Github repo, this is a great app framework! 

Until then, enjoy and make sure to follow me, `@derekjanni`, on Twitter!
